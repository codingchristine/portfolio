# Christine Black Full Stack Portfolio
Web portfolio of my work during my MIT Full Stack Course

## Project Notes
In this assignment I utlized Github pages to set up my portfolio site so it can be a reference to use for future prospective jobs. I used Bootstrap as a starting point and customized from there.

## Next Steps
As I continue in the course I will add more of my work and continue to update this portfolio.
